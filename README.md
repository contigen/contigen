Hi! IÊ¼m Muhammed Tijani, alias contigen.
I started learning Web development in 2020, and I have worked with various libraries, frameworks and languages; done a lot of learning and relearning; read through the whole HTML & CSS MDN reference circa 2020/21, crazy right?

I get a kick from exploring and integrating Browser Web APIs that interact with the OS & hardware talk about Web Speech API, Contact Picker API and co. I aim to fully incorporate accessibility standards, micro-interactions, and whatnots into my work.

I'm obsesssed with typography.
