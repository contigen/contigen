Hi! IÊ¼m Muhammed Tijani, alias contigen.
I started learning Web development in 2020, and I have worked with various libraries, frameworks and languages; done a lot of learning and relearning; read through the whole HTML & CSS MDN reference circa 2020/21, crazy right?

I'm obsesssed with typography.

I'm looking for a front-end/full-stack role with React/Next.js; if youÊ¼re hiring or you know someone, kindly reach out on [X](https://x.com/_contigen).

PS I maintain a package with over 13k+ downloads: [non.geist](https://github.com/contigen/non.geist)
